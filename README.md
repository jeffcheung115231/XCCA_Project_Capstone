## UCLA Protest Tweets Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a capstone project exploring the characteristics and patterns of tweets related to the UCLA protests in 2021. 

**Project Objectives:**

* **Narrative Detection:** Identify key themes and discussions within the tweet corpus.
* **Topic Modeling:** Analyze the sentiment expressed in the tweets and identify influential users.
* **Geographic and Temporal Analysis:** Investigate the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of the protest-related tweets.

**Dataset Description:**

The dataset consists of 18,930 tweets related to the UCLA protests in 2021. Each tweet includes information such as text, user ID, user metadata (e.g., follower count, friends count), timestamp, and other tweet-related metadata.

**Methodology:**

This project employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to gain a comprehensive understanding of the UCLA protest-related tweets. The analysis techniques include:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding the dataset's structure, distribution of variables, and identifying patterns or anomalies.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing the sentiment expressed in the tweet text using natural language processing techniques.
* **User Influence Analysis:** Evaluating user influence based on metrics such as follower count, friends count, and total interaction count.
* **Temporal and Spatial Analysis:** Examining the temporal dynamics and geographic distribution of the protest-related tweets.
* **Topic Modeling:** Applying topic modeling techniques to identify the key themes and discussions within the tweet corpus.

**Key Findings:**

* **Sentiment Analysis:** The majority of tweets expressed positive or neutral sentiments, with a smaller proportion of negative sentiments.
* **User Influence Analysis:** Several highly influential users played a significant role in the protest discourse, including activists, journalists, and university affiliates.
* **Temporal Analysis:** The tweet volume fluctuated throughout the protest period, with peaks corresponding to major events or developments.
* **Spatial Analysis:** The protest-related tweets originated from a diverse geographic distribution, with a concentration in the Los Angeles area.
* **Topic Modeling:** The key themes discussed in the tweets included the reasons for the protests, the university's response, and broader discussions around social justice and activism.

**Code Structure:**

The repository is structured as follows:

* **`data/`:** Contains the raw dataset and preprocessed data.
* **`scripts/`:** Contains the Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* **`reports/`:** Contains the project report and presentations.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages (refer to the `requirements.txt` file).
3. Run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory to reproduce the analysis.
